# micro-genai-tools
A growing collection of small, focused generative AI utilities designed to automate everyday tasks and boost personal productivity.

This repo houses a set of lightweight, script-based tools that I’ve built to solve real problems in my own workflow — from transcribing audio and summarizing meetings, to converting handwritten notes into editable documents or presentations. Most tools are built in Python and use either open-source models or APIs (like OpenAI, Whisper, GPT-4o, etc.).

These tools are meant to be:

Practical – built for everyday use, with real utility

Modular – each tool is a self-contained script or app

Reproducible – easy to run and adapt for your own needs

Whether you're an engineer, student, researcher, or just someone curious about GenAI's power in personal workflows, feel free to explore, fork, and extend.
